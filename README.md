## Statistical Analysis
Some statistical projects require practical experience to be fully comprehended. In this repository, I am endeavoring to execute a few small-scale projects in order to offer tangible illustrations for data analysis utilizing the R language.

some of the most important libries throughout these projects are: 

## ggplot2
This is the backbone of this project. ggplot2 is the most popular data visualization library that is most widely used for creating aesthetic visualization plots.


## dplyr
This package is the lingua franca of data manipulation in R.
