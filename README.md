## Statistical Analysis
Some statistical projects require practical experience to be fully comprehended. In this repository, I am endeavoring to execute a few small-scale projects in order to offer tangible illustrations for data analysis utilizing the R language.

some of the most important libries throughout these projects are: 
## tidyverse
Tidyverse is designed to provide a comprehensive set of tools for data manipulation, visualization, and analysis. By installing tidyverse, you get access to all the core packages in the collection, including ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, and other packages.

## ggplot2
This is the backbone of this project. ggplot2 is the most popular data visualization library that is most widely used for creating aesthetic visualization plots.


## dplyr
This package is the lingua franca of data manipulation in R.

## projects
1) The introductory tutorial using R commands such as summary to load Iris dataset.
2) This tutorial briefly shows you how to do statistical analysis using R, how to do t-test, linear regression, and explores libraries such as ggplot2 and dplyr.
3) starwars-datacleaning: teaches how to filter out rows, and columns and how to deal with missing and duplicate values, at the end of the tutorial, it teaches how to reord categorical values.
