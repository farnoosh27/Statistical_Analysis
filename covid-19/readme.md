## objective 
The t-test is being used in this code to determine whether there is a statistically significant difference in the mean age between individuals who died and those who did not.

The null hypothesis of the t-test is that the mean age of individuals who died is equal to the mean age of those who did not die. The alternative hypothesis is that the mean age of individuals who died is different from the mean age of those who did not die.

By running the t-test with a significance level of 0.05, we are testing whether the observed difference in mean age between the two groups is statistically significant or simply due to chance. The t-test output provides a p-value, which tells us the probability of observing a difference in mean age as extreme as the one we observed, assuming that the null hypothesis is true.

If the p-value is less than the significance level (0.05), we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a statistically significant difference in the mean age between individuals who died and those who did not. If the p-value is greater than the significance level, we fail to reject the null hypothesis, which means that we do not have enough evidence to conclude that there is a significant difference in mean age between the two groups.
## Libraries: 
The Hmisc library is a package in R that provides various functions for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. Some of the commonly used functions in this library include:

## Questions:
1) do death people have a higher mortality rate?
2) are male more likely to die from Covid-19?
